# Mini Company Website – Resonira Technologies
**Author:** Saideep 

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a mini multi-page company website created as part of an HTML assignment.  
It includes three fully structured pages:
- **index.html** – Home Page  
- **services.html** – Services Page  
- **contact.html** – Contact Page  

---

## ✅ What I Have Implemented
- A complete **company-style website** for Resonira Technologies  
- Navigation bar across all pages  
- Semantic HTML structure  
- Service sections with headings, descriptions, and lists  
- Contact page with a fully functional HTML form (labels, inputs, select, radio, textarea, date, checkbox)  
- Responsive-friendly page structure and basic styling  
- Footer on all pages  
- YouTube iframe embeded 
- FAQ section using `<details>` and `<summary>`  
- Ordered list for “How We Work”. 

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues
- CSS responsiveness may need more improvement on smaller screens  
- The contact form does not send data (no backend connected) — HTML-only as per assignment  
- Some content may shift on extremely narrow screens  
- YouTube iframe may not load if the browser blocks third-party content
